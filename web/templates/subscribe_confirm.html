    <p>Thank you for subscribing! You are now a Premium user and have full access to your data that was previously locked up within the GAS (unfairly, we know). Please <a href="{{ url_for('annotations_list') }}">click here</a> to view your annotation results.</p>

    <p>Your subscriber account number is <strong>{{ stripe_id }}</strong>. Please make a note of this since the GAS service doesn't. Yes, we know we should, but at this stage we have your money and credit card details so we don't care much!</p>
